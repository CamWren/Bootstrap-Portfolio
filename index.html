        		Hello there, my name is Cameron Wren. I hail from Brenham, Texas, home of Blue Bell Ice Cream, along with a bunch of cows, Aggies, and other general minutae that comes with being from small-town Texas. I played soccer growing up, my main position being goalkeeper. After two consective runs at the state championship having the gold medal elude me both times, I decided to forgo a promising professional soccer career and go to college.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		The Texas hill country was calling my name, I personally felt that I looked damn good in burnt orange, and I had to be somewhere where live music was easily accessible on any given day of the week so I packed my '98 Landcruiser to the brim with my belongings (a couple of guitars and some clothes) and bolted down US290 to Austin, Texas.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		I graduated from The Univerisity of Texas at Austin in December of 2013 with a BS in Advertising, Certificate in Business, and Minor in Spanish. Young, naive, and eager to get a piece of the money pie, I headed to Dallas in January of 2014 to join a marketing company. I quickly found myself living the life of Peter Gibbons in Office Space so I rented a UHAUL and high-tailed it back to Austin not 10 months after I had left for Dallas.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        		Today I am newly engaged, work as a Fermenttion Specialist at Austin Eastciders, and back to being a student learning something I've always wanted to know how to do: coding. If you've made it this far, I really appreciate you taking the time to read a little about who I am. Prosit!
